<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 3 (150+25 pts: Spring, 2018)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
In this lab you will write a program for embedding ascii text
within a PPM image using a randomized algorithm for selecting
where to place the characters. 
We will call the program "crypto" which makes it sound
as if it is based on cryptography. In reality, it is a
case of steganography which according to Wikipedia
"is the art or practice of concealing a file, message, image, 
or video within another file, message, image, or video."
Either way, the program is actually pretty cool. 

<p>
Before you get any ideas to turn it into an app that
will make your rich, be forewarned that somebody may
hold a patent on a similar idea. 
The goal of the exercise
is to have you apply many of the things we have discussed since
the begining of the semester. No attempt has been made to
research the literature on the subjects of steganography
and crytopgraphy.
<p>

<b>
Please raise questions and concerns about the assignment 
(including inconsistencies or unspoken design criteria)
on piazza.com sooner rather than 
later so that clarifications can be shared with the class
as early in the two week window as possible.

<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>
Submit your work via Canvas no later than
9:59am Monday February 26, 2018.
You submit three files, namely, support.h, support.cpp
and Crypto.cpp.
The incremental development outlined below is merely 
intended to walk you through the process of completing
the assignment.
Note: The techniques needed to the write
random number generator mentioned below 
will not be covered till 
Tuesday February 13, 2018. But don't worry,
you will have plenty to do before then.
<p>

<h3>Getting started and what you need to do</h3>

To help you get started,
run the Hydra script
/home/cs302/labs/lab3/copy to obtain the following files: 
crypto1-3 (Hydra solution executables for the three incremental
codes), support.h, support.cpp, and Crypto.cpp (skeleton code),
plane.ppm, rocket.ppm, and truck.ppm (test images), and
a makefile.
Your job is to complete writing the program
and make it behave as described next.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
<b>Support.h</b>: This header file defines a template
based 2D matrix class,  
a pixel index class,
an RGB class, and a ppm image class. 
<p>

The 2D matrix class can be either version 1 or version 2
from the matrix handout, as version 3 will not work correctly
with the implementation defined later on. 
The constructor should be changed to simply
set the data pointer equal to NULL. 
A new public member function called assign() 
should be added that allocates the needed 
memory given two parameters, Nrows and Ncols.
A new public member function called data()
should be added that returns a pointer to the
matrix buffer. This is needed by the ppm::read() and
ppm::write() functions. With this class being template
based, all code needs to be included in the header
file. If you like, it can even be included in the
class definition.
<p>

The pixel index class is merely a struct that stores
a pair of row and column indices. The constructor
should allow instantiation both with and without 
new values for these indices. The default
constructor should set both indices to 0.
With this class being so simple, all code can be
included in the class definition.
<p>

The RBG class, which is also just a struct, defines
a three char data structure with members R, G, and B.
The default constructor sets the values of these to 0.
With this class being so simple, all code can be
included in the class definition.
<p>

The ppm image class must define all functionality
needed to read, write, and store a P6 type ppm image.
Public member functions include the constructor 
which initializes all member data, read() and write()
functions, an overloaded []-operator for index based
lookup, and get_Nrows() and get_Ncols() functions for
exporting these data variables. All member data must
be private and the image must be stored as a
matrix<RGB> object. The read() and write() functions
are described below. The []-operator returns a pointer 
to the image row corresponding to the integer index
given to it.
All but the read() and write() function code can be
included in the class definition.

<LI> 
<b>Support.cpp</b>: This file contains the 
implementation for the ppm::read() and ppm::write()
functions which both take one argument, namely,
the name of the file.
<p>

The ppm::read() function opens the specified file,
then reads the header information followed by the
image data.
Error checking must be included for 
successful opening of the file 
(hint: cf. fstream::is_open()), 
the proper P6 format, 
a max value of 255, and the correct number
of bytes read.
<p>

The ppm::write() function creates file name
"image_wmsg.ppm" (assuming the input file was "image.ppm")
where "wmsg" is short
for "with message" (in other words, an image which
has text embedded within it), opens the file,
then writes the header information followed by the 
image data.
Error checking must be included for 
successful opening of the file 
(hint: cf. ios::is_open()).
<p>

<LI>
<b>Crypto.cpp</b>: This file implements the
main() function, the encode() and decode()
functions as all as all other support code
which includes a set_pixel_list() function.
<p>

The main() function parses command line arguments
"-encode|decode image.ppm" where
the pipe symbol means logical OR (standard unix).
A meaningful error message is printed if 
the proper "-encode|decode" mode option is missing
not present, as well as if an unknown option is 
given.
A ppm image object is instantiated. 
The specified ppm file is read and passed
to the encode() or decode() function as appropriate.
<p>

<b>Version 1</b>
Crypto1 creates the framework for the asssignment. 
First write the set_pixel_list() function which 
adds pixel index objects to a vector list. The
function is given two arguments: a reference to
a ppm imge object and a reference to said 
vector list. For now, have the function add all
even pixel index pairs, i.e., 
(0,0), (0,2), (0,4), ..., (2,0), (2,2), ..., 
etc. You change this in Crypto2.
<p>

The encode() function instantiates the vector
list of pixel indices and calls the set_pixel_list()
function to populate it.
Then text is read from standard input (cin) and
encoded into the ppm image. 
The basic idea is to replace one RGB bit
with one text bit in locations specified by the
pixel index list. 
Warning:
You may have to read the how-to description 
several times before you fully understand the process. 
<p>

Read and encode the text one character at a time
including all white space
(hint: cf. fstream::get()). Furthermore, extract
and encode one character bit at a time. 
The pixel index list tells you which pixels to
target. Use one pixel per character bit. 
Alternate between the red, green, and blue 
color values. Use bit logic to extract the
bits in order from LSB to MSB 
(hint: x&gt;&gt;k shifts
the k<i>th</i> bit to the LSB position and
x &amp; 0x1 sets all but the LSB to 0). 
Use bit logic to encode the extracted bit.
That is, replace the LSB of the target pixel color
with the extracted character bit
(hint: x &amp;= 0xFE zeros out the x-LSB while
x |= (y &amp; 0x1) sets it to the y-LSB).
When all the text has been processed, add an ETX
(0x3) character, so you know when to stop
when decoding an image. The ETX has been included
in the provided support files for your convenience.
<p>

The decode() function reverses the process. Once
you understand how the encoding works, this is
relatively simple. Create the same pixel index
list and use it to extract the LSB from
eight pixels. Combine these to form a character
that you print to standard out 
(hint: cf. fstream::put()). Stop when the ETX
character has been extracted.
If you do it right, you see the same text as
you encoded. If you don't, you get garbage.
<p>

<b>Version 2</b>
Crypto2 adds randomness to the pixel index list.
Without, somebody might figure out how to read your 
secret text by detecting patterns. As unlikely as
that is, and we want to make it nearly impossible.
Specifically, we will distribute the eight bits of 
each text character across eight randomly chosen pixels.
Instead of just using the standard random number 
generator (which we could seed with a secret number),
we will use a data driven distribution to make it
even more unique. 
For simplity we will use the ppm input image. A
more sophisticated version would use another image
but we will not go there.
<p>

Modify the set_pixel_list() function as follows.
First compute a histogram of the color values 
for all pixels. To keep the size of the histogram managable,
extract the four most significant bits from each color byte
and combine these half-bytes to obtain a 12-bit color
integer.
That is, color =
(R&gt;&gt;4) &lt;&lt 8 | (G&gt;&gt;4) &lt;&lt 4 | (B&gt;&gt;4).
Then instantiate a random number generator that can 
produce random numbers with probabilities that are
proportional to these histogram counts.
Use this random number generator to permute 
the pixel index list. 
In order to support processing of more than 2^12 = 4K
pixels, combine two of these random numbers to form
a 24-bit number that allows processing of 2^24 = 16M pixels.
That is, r24 = r1_12 &lt;&lt; 12) | r2_12.
The heavy lifting can be done using the code
rnumgen and randperm handouts.
Add the rnumgen class definition to support.h,
and add the member function implementations to
support.cpp. Use a seed value of 0.
Incorporate the randperm idea into the set_pixel_list() 
function.
<p>

If you do the above exactly the same way as the solution code,
one can decode what the other encodes.
If you do even the slightest thing differently 
(including when and how many times you call the random number 
generator), your code will not work with encodings produced 
by the solution code, but you can 
still have fun as it may work with its own encodings.
Brilliant!
<p>

<b>Version 3</b>
<i>Crypto3 is required in order for CS307 students to get full credit but optional and available
for extra credit for CS302 students. That is, CS307 students will have up to 25 points deducted
if the functionality described next is not included or doesn't work right. CS302 students 
will have up to 25 points added if they complete this successfully.</i>
<p>

A simple, but effective encryption method consists of repeatly applying XOR to the characters
of the text with characters in a secret key known only to the sender and the receiver. Say the
text character is c and the key character is k, then it is easily seen that c=XOR(XOR(c,k)).
We will apply this idea as follows. The main() function will accept -key="text" as
an optional third argument. The encode() and decode() functions will be given this text as a
second argument. The length of the key will be passed to the set_pixel_list() function which
uses it to seed the random number generator. When a key is not specified, the key text is the
empty string which has a length of 0 as used for Version 2. The encode() and decode() functions
apply XOR to each character before encoding and after decoding, respectively
(hint: XOR(x,y) = x^y). When the key text consists of multiple characters, use these in 
an alternating fashion.
